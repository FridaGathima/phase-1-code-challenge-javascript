# PHASE 1 CODE CHALLENGE - JAVASCRIPT.

This repository contains 3 code challenges that were to be solved using JavaScript only. 
The challenges were:

**#1. Student Grade Generator.**
This code outputs various student grades between A and E according to the marks achieved between 0 and 100.
The code prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. 
Any number outside of that range for example -50 or 110, outputs Invalid Marks. 

**#2. Speed Detector.**
The speed limit is set at 70.
This code is used to calculate by how many kilometers a car travels above the speed limit and demerit points are awarded as such. If the speed is below 70, then no demerit point is awarded.
The code prompts the user to input the speed of the car. The input should be greater than 0.

**#3. Net Salary Calculator**
This code calculates the net salary based on the statutory deductions. These are PAYE Tax, NHIF Deductions and NSSF Deductions. The net salary is normally calculated as:
    Net Salary = Gross Salry - (PAYE + NHIF + NSSF)
The code prompts the user to input the gross salary, and based on these deductions, it will calculate the net salary and output it.
